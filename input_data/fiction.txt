Once upon a time, there was a little puppy named Max. Max loved to play in the garden. One day, he chased a butterfly and got lost. He looked around but couldn’t find his way home. Max felt scared and started to bark.
A kind girl named Lily heard him and followed the sound. When she saw Max, she picked him up and said, "Don’t worry, little puppy. I’ll take you home." 
Lily asked her neighbors if they knew Max. Finally, they found his house. Max's owner was so happy! Max learned to always stay close to home after that.
