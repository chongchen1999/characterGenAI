# Character-Based Model Experiments

This repository contains experiments with a character-based neural network model on various types of text. The goal is to deepen the understanding of how the model performs with different inputs and to observe its strengths and limitations.

## Purpose

By experimenting with different datasets, this project aims to:
- Reinforce understanding of the model’s mechanics
- Observe how the model behaves with different types of text
- Gain insights into the model's strengths and limitations

## Dataset Selection Guidelines

To ensure a diverse learning experience, follow these guidelines when selecting datasets for the model:

1. **Length**: Start with shorter texts (a few paragraphs to a few pages) to keep computation time manageable.
2. **Variety**: Experiment with different genres and styles of writing, such as:
   - **Fiction** (e.g., short stories)
   - **Non-fiction** (e.g., news articles)
   - **Technical writing** (e.g., scientific abstracts)
   - **Poetry or song lyrics**
3. **Language**: Optionally, test texts in different languages to observe how the model handles different character sets.
4. **Preprocessing**: Make sure to preprocess the text (e.g., removing special characters) if the model isn’t designed to handle them.
5. **Vocabulary Size**: Monitor the unique character count in each dataset, as it will impact the size of your embedding layers.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Modify the data loading functions to accommodate different text formats and structures.
- Preprocess the text as needed by cleaning or removing unwanted characters.

### 2. Model Parameters
- Adjust model parameters such as embedding size and sequence length to optimize performance based on the chosen text.

### 3. Model Training
- Train the model on each selected dataset.
- Monitor performance metrics such as loss and accuracy during training.

### 4. Result Comparison
- Compare the model's performance across different datasets.
- Analyze why certain texts yield better or worse results.

## Experimentation

To begin experimenting with the model:
1. Select a dataset following the guidelines mentioned above.
2. Preprocess the text.
3. Train the model and observe its performance.
4. Experiment with various texts to gain insights into model strengths and limitations.

## Analysis

Analyze the following aspects:
- How does the model perform on different text types?
- How well does it handle various languages and writing styles?
- What are the limitations of the model?
